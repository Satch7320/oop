# OOP

Object Oriented programming is a major design pattern in many modern computer languages.  Python highly leverages these patterns, so it is very important that you understand how to use and create objects.

## Standards

<li>Given the code for a python class, instantiate a python object and call the methods and list the attributes.</li>
<li>Write the python code for a simple class.</li>
<li>Match key “magic” methods to their functionality.</li>
<li>Design a program or algorithm in object oriented fashion.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast functional and object oriented programming.</li>
</ol>
