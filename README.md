# Object Oriented Programming

Today we'll be getting practice with writing code with objects and classes.

We have included three short projects.  Your instructor will let you know which of these project they would like you to use for practice.

## Simple GUI

Build a simple graphical interface to draw shaped on a canvas.  You will start by implementing basic shapes, and them move on to shape operations.  Finally, you will implement a small little language for describing pictures made up of shapes.

This assignment is [here](gui).

## Cards

As an assignment to expand on an implementation of the card game War, and then modify the existing versions of `Player` and `Deck` classes to write your own Blackjack game.

This assignment is [here](cards).

## Polynomial

Implement a class for representing polynomial objects.  The class will support common mathematical operations on polynomials (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and evaluation) in addition to printing and display.
